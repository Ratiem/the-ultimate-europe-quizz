# The Ultimate Europe Quizz

The Ultimate Europe Quiz is a fun interesting quiz aimed at testing the user on their general knowledge of the European Countries in travel and geography. This Simple trivia game is perfect for any get together event as friends or even a simple trivia night. 

The idea of the project was inspired by my love for Europe and travel. From a young age I have always had a passion for travel after being introduced to the beauty of travel by my parents at a young age. After my first Europe experience I never looked back. I found the questions to be a fun quiz for myself as well to test how much of Europe knowledge I have gathered since my first experience and the idea is that the user enjoys the game as much as l did and is inspired to explore the beauty of Europe one day.

The content of the quiz is designed for all ages. There are no age restrictions. The website is responsive in all major screen devices that is desktop, laptop, tablet and smartphone.

# Features 

## Home page

On this page you will find the main title and a brief introduction to the quiz. The home page also contains the logo image of Country signs, the start quiz button and rules button.

## Rules page

The rules are found on the home page( landing page of the quiz). And these are set to give the user some guidance on how to play the quiz. Once the user has finished reading the rules they will be guided to the start quiz button. The rules will then disappear when the user proceeds to click the start quiz button.

## Quiz page

In this section, after selecting the start quiz button, the user will be directed to the very first question which like all questions to follow will always have two options to choose from(true of false). On the quiz page the user will only see the question, the answer options, the score and the next button which should be clicked after the user has selected the correct answer so as to proceed to the next question.

For each question that the user will be working on they will know what number it is as this will be displayed at the top of the game area. There are 12 questions to answer. The correct answer option turns green when clicked while if the answer is wrong the button turns red.

## End Page
At the end of the answering the 12 questions, the game is over and the user will be taken to the final page of the game. The user will get a congratulations message for completing the game. 

There is no restart button for the player to play the quiz again. The game will marked as over.

## Future Features

In future I could possibly add:
- An option to replay again with possibly a set of new questions.
- Timer element to make it more fun.


## Design Choices

### Color
I used simple color choices for both the background and the quiz area. 

### Fonts
I was drawn to the combination of Ubuntu and Opens sans. A very soft combination and easy on the eyes.
I was immediately drawn to the font Ubuntu and found the perfect pairing for this font on https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/best-google-fonts-pairings


### Structure
The website has 3 main pages being:
- The Home page which displays the Intro area. On this page you will find the start quiz and rules button.
- The Quiz area which displays all the 12 questions one at a time and answer options. At the bottom of this page we also see the score and next button. This page contains the next button and score level.
- The final page is the end of the game page which will show the user a closing message.

### Bugs to be fixed

| **Bug** | **Attempted Fixes**| **Result** | 
|-------------|------------|------------|
|During the final check of the quiz functionality I noticed the questions go as far as question 11 and game ends instead of ending after question 12. The Check answer function was allowing the user to select either of the answers instead of allowing user to select one suitable answer.|I tried to adjust the global variable of question counter as well as review the next question function. I disabled two buttons when an answer has been selected, and re-enabling them when user moves to next question.|Due to unforeseen events which were communicated to student care, i had to redo this project while in remote areas and very limited network. I did not manage to fix this issue before submission. The user is now able to click only one answer.
